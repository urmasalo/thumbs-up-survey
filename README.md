# Mauricio Salazar Test

## Considerations:

- This project was made using create-react-app.
- I couldn`t get the candidates images from the given comp file so I used third party images.
- I used Fontawesome in order to make the development faster.
- In order to improve performance I used google fonts.
- For styling I used SASS for the convenience of the use of variables and nested styles.
- For Behavior I used React, for several reasons like speed in development, organization of site in components and the reusability of code,
  besides is the library I feel more comfortable with.
- The testing was made using jest and @testing-library.

## Installation

In order to review the “Layout HTML-CSS” task checkout the branch `layout-html-css`.

For the interaction task checkout the branch `main`.

Then follow the next steps:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
